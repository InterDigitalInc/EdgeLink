# EdgeLink

InterDigitalâ€™s EdgeLink (mmW Mesh Transport) is a wireless 5G solution that can deliver high capacity links with very low latency.  It is capable of multiplexing packetized Fronthaul and Backhaul traffic on a unified network under the control of Software Defined Networking (SDN) mesh controller over long range mmW links using high gain fixed antennas installed with Edgelink nodes .  The system can be installed indoor or outdoor to provide network connectivity over an unlicensed 60 GHz data link.

EdgeLink requires the presence of nodes linked in a mesh network, a mesh controller (based on ONOS), and an orchestrator.
